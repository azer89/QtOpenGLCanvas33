A custom Qt canvas with Modern OpenGL which uses VBOs and VAOs to perform rendering. 

The canvas is a combination of QAbstractScrollArea and QGLWidget, therefore the canvas can be scrolled and zoomed in/out.

The program is really simple since it only draws an n-gon. Press right button to add the number of the sides, and press left to do the opposite.
